**# Sentiment Analysis using Twitter Data in Python #

* **Installation**
* **Working**
* **Theory**

## Installation ##

* Clone the repository into the local repository
* we will need python and the following modules for installtion:-

  1. nltk

  2. sklearn

  3. ggplotter

  4. statistics 

* we can install the above modules using pip commands onto the system
* we will have to create a twitter app in order to stream in data from twitter.Thus the following steps will have to be followed for collecting data from twitter:-

1. After you sign in, you’ll be taken to your application creation page. Be sure to fill in your application’s name, a description about your application and a placeholder for the website field in correct format. Leave the callback url field blank. This tells your app to return to this location after authenticating.

2. Read and agree to Twitter’s “Developer Rules Of The Road”. Check the box next to “Yes, I agree”.

3. In the space below, enter the characters you see in the CAPTCHA and click on the “Create your Twitter application” button.

4.. Doing this will take you to your Twitter app’s detail page. Under the OAuth settings, you’ll see that your app’s Access level is set to “Read-only” by default. To enable members to post to Twitter, click on the Settings tab at the top to change the Access level from “Read-only” to “Read and Write”.  Also check the box next to where it reads, “Allow this application to be used to Sign In with Twitter.”
