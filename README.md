* we will have to create a twitter app in order to stream in data from twitter.Thus the following steps will have to be followed for collecting data from twitter:-
a. After you sign in, you’ll be taken to your application creation page. Be sure to fill in your application’s name, a description about your application and a placeholder for the website field in correct format. Leave the callback url field blank. This tells your app to return to this location after authenticating.

b. Read and agree to Twitter’s “Developer Rules Of The Road”. Check the box next to “Yes, I agree”.

c. In the space below, enter the characters you see in the CAPTCHA and click on the “Create your Twitter application” button.
